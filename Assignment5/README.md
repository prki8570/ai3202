# Assignment 5

To run, type

```
python Kikkeri_Assignment5.py World1MDP.txt (epsilon value)
```
where epsilon value is a float.

### Answer to question

I found that the optimal path did not change no matter what I changd the epsilon value to. I got tired after I went through about five powers of 10 with still no change to the optimal path. The only thing that changed between each epsilon value was the utility at each space.

The optimal path I got is:

(0, 0)
(0, 1)
(0, 2)
(0, 3)
(1, 3)
(1, 4)
(1, 5)
(2, 5)
(3, 5)
(4, 5)
(4, 6)
(4, 7)
(5, 7)
(6, 7)
(7, 7)
(8, 7)
